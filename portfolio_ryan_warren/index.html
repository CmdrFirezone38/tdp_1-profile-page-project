        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a full time web development student excited to learn more and more about how websites are designed and made. One of my favorite things about web development is the fact that I can write just a few lines of code and have something to be able to put on the web. It's an incredible feeling.</p>
        <p>I was going into the military, but was medically discharged and had to come home. So, now I am learning web development which is something I have been wanting to learn for a long time.</p>
